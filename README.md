# facelift

This gem will someday (soon, I hope) process Ruby code, automatically
transforming expressions which are not idiomatic Ruby to functionally-
equivalent, idiomatic expressions.

## Intro

Ruby provides us many ways to do the same thing. The intention of facelift is
to help you discover when your code could be expressed easier or more simply
using built-in methods or a common Ruby idioms.
